<br>But what is a demon, anyway?

Martin writes that there are a couple of reasons. First, to Greek-speaking Jews, daimons were gods of other nations, not creatures within their religion.<br> And second, the translators might have wanted to avoid suggesting that angels were anything like minor gods.</p><p>There are a few cases in pre-Christian texts in which angels have a connection with something like demons. <br>In the ancient Jewish text of the Book of Enoch, “watchers”—or angels—mate with human women, producing giants.
